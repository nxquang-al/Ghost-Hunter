## Scenario

`Ghost Hunter` is an endless action game. You'll play as a character in pajamas armed with a rifle, and your mission is simple: defeat as many ghosts as possible, while not letting them get you! Move around using your keyboard and shoot by clicking your mouse in the direction you want. Occasionally, a yellow orb is spawned on the map, which gives the character bonus movement speed when he/she picks it up. Additionally, the player will be healed when picking up the green orb. The player gets 10 points for each ghost taken down, minus 10 points for each collision with the ghost and the game ends when the character’s health bar reaches zero.

- Control the player through space and try to survive as long as possible. Defeat the enemy will give you points
